      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        As the founder of Dented Code Academy, I've dedicated my career to
        bridging the gap between academic knowledge and real-world tech industry
        demands. Recognizing the challenges many face when transitioning from
        academia to a professional setting, I've tailored our curriculum and
        mentoring programs to ensure our students are not just technically
        proficient but also industry-ready.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With my hands-on experience as a Software Engineer and a passion for
        teaching, I've successfully guided numerous students to secure their
        first IT roles. Through a blend of practical skills training, industry
        insights, and mentorship, I've created a learning environment where
        success stories are the norm, not the exception.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Perhaps you could be next. If you're an aspiring tech professional
        aiming to break into the industry, I can help. Together, we can shape
        the future of tech education and career transitions.
